1. Data Exploration
- How do the trends and patterns in the 2022_04_22_hour_heartbeat_merged.csv dataset
compare to those observed in the Hourly_merged.csv dataset?
> The variance in the new dataset is more time-dependent.
- We can see the night time when steps is 0 and heartbeat is\
low. Two of the users have missing data periods.

2. Data Preprocessing
- After handling missing values, how does the distribution change?
Are there significant shifts in mean or variance?
> There is a negligable amount of missing values,
so the distribution doesn't change.
-How does the scaling of training and testing data separately impact
the range and distribution of the scaled values?
> Each feature is guaranteed to be normalized for train and test set,
which means having range [0, 1] for MinMaxScaler and mean=0, std=1 for StandardScaler.
- How might scaling the entire dataset (training + testing)
introduce potential biases?
> The mean and variance of training set and testing set
may be different from each other, because the data is a time series.
That means the scaling doesn't actually normalize the two sets.
