1. Data Understanding
- What kind of data are we dealing with?
> Information about physical activity, aggregated by hours
- What are the key features in the dataset?
> Calories, total intensity, step total vary a lot by time.
Distribution of values is skewed to small values.

2. Summary Statistics
- What insights can you gather from the summary statistics?
> Comparing std deviation and mean, calories vary less than intensity or step count.
There are very large values from all features which should be filtered.
- Are there any features that have extremely high or low values?
> Yes, all of them, calories and step especially.
- How would you interpret the standard deviation for features like Calories aand StepTotal?
> Calories has less deviation, because the brain uses a lot of energy even in calm state,
so the peaks and valleys are not so sharp. Steps varies from 0 to 10000, depending on the day.

3. Data visualization
- What patterns or trends can you observe from the time series plots?
> High variance and clusters of activity and rest.
- Are there any noticeable outliers?
> A period of no activity.
- How would you interpret the variability in Calories, TotalIntensity, and StepTotal?
> There are periods of activity and rest.

4. Missing values
- How would you handle missing values if there were any?
> Replace by 0 or by mean.
- Why is it important to deal with missing values before proceeding to model training?
> The program will crash or (worse) will not work.

5. Data Scaling (Normalization)
- Why is data scaling important in time-series analysis, especially when using LSTMs?
> Difference in mean and standard deviation between features will cause unstable 
or slow learning because of skewed loss function landscape.
- What are some other scaling methods you could use, and how do they differ from Min-Max Scaling?
> One way is to remove small percentile (1%) of very small of very large values before
scaling, so the distribution is more even. Second is standard scaling, which means -mean /std.
It assures mean=0 and std=1. These properties allow to construct a simpler ML model.
